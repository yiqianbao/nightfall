# sha256() vs sha256compression()

We consider some examples to see the differences in the hashing functions provided by ZoKrates.

## Summary

For a binary message `M` of bit length `l`, denote `I` as the entire 512bit binary input to the sha
function, and denote `O` as the output. Let `K` be the 'padding string' for sha256; a single `1`
followed by `k` zeroes. I.e. `K = 1 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0` is of total length `k+1`. Let `P` be a padding
string of all zeroes, of length `p`. Let `Z` be a 64bit binary representation of the value `l`. `|`
is a concatenation symbol.

**sha256compression()** `sha256compression(I) = O` where: `I = M | K | Z` for `l <= 447` and
`l + k + 1 = 448`. So the message length is restricted to 447bits, and the length of the input `I`
_must_ be exactly 512bits. I.e. sha256compression expects a 512bit binary input which _already
contains_ sha-compliant padding. Hence, this is only useful for hashing messages which are strictly
_smaller_ in bit-length than 448bits. If your message `M` is indeed strictly smaller than 448bits,
then this function is much more efficient to use than sha256(). Note that you will need to pad `M`
with `K` and `Z` yourself.

**To calculate `sha256compression( M | K | Z )` in zokrates is equivalent to calculating
`sha256(abi.encodePacked( M ))` in Solidity.**

sha256() `sha256(I) = O` where: `I = M` and `M` is of length `l = 512` exactly. The sha256()
function seems to assume that your entire input is the 512bit message. If you want to send a message
`M'` to sha256() which has bit-length `l' < 512`, you will need to create custom (non-standard)
padding `P`, where `p + l' = 512`, and pass an input `I' = P | M'` (or indeed you can pass any other
permutation of padding, given that this is 'custom-padding' - as long as you keep track of how
you've padded your message!)

**So to calculate `sha256(M)` in zokrates is equivalent to calculating `sha256(abi.encodePacked(M))`
in Solidity.**

**To calculate `sha256( M' | P )` in zokrates is equivalent to calculating
`sha256(abi.encodePacked( M' | P ))` in Solidity.**

**Note:**

_All solidity test code implemented in Remix as follows:_

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
import "remix_tests.sol"; // this import is automatically injected by Remix.
contract test {
  bytes input = hex'ffff';
  bytes32 output;
  function shaIt() public returns (bytes32) {
    output = sha256(abi.encodePacked(input));
    return output;
  }
}
```

_Only the value of `input` was changed for each example._

_For sha256compression():_ As above but replacing the `sha256()` with `sha256compression()`

_For each example, a binary witness was passed to the main() function through:_
`./zokrates compute-witness -a <512bit space-separated binary string>`

_For each example, the binary output from the zokrates console has been converted to hexadecimal by
me 'behind the scenes', to make visual comparisons easier for us when reading this document._
