# Nightfall Zero-Knowledge Proof Service

*This module is part of Nightfall. Most users will only be interested in using the application as a whole, we direct those readers to [the main README](../../README.md). This file provides additional information on how this module works so you can learn about, tinker and improve it.*

## Tasks you can perform

### Run zkp service unit tests

Before running these tests, you will need to have completed the trusted setup. This is done simply
by running (from the Nightfall root):

```sh
npm run setupAll
```
If you have previously run the Nightfall application, you will already have completed this step and there is no need to repeat it (it takes about and hour so it's worth avoiding where possible!).

_Alternatively_, if you change one of the proofs in the Nightfall suite, then you can perform the
trusted setup for just that proof, which is a lot faster. You need to change to the zkp sub directory
to do that:

```sh
cd zkp
npm run setup -- -i gm17/<dir containing your proof>
cd ..
```

After your trusted setup is complete run:

```sh
make truffle-compile truffle-migrate
```

This will run up ganache in a container and load all of the nightfall contracts.

To run the zkp unit tests:

```sh
make zkp-test
```

The relevant files for these tests can be found under `zkp/__tests__`.

- `f-token-controller.test.js` - These are units tests to verify mint, transfer and burn of ERC-20
  tokens and ERC-20 commitments
- `nf-token-controller.test.js` - These are units tests to verify mint, transfer and burn of ERC-721
  tokens and ERC-721 commitments
- `utils.test.js` - These are unit tests for utils used for running the tests.

Note that the zkp service tests take a while to run (approx. 1 hour)


### Development

Running the zkp module as part of the fully application is handled by Docker Compose. But you will be running this directly on your machine. Prerequesites for development of Nightfall are documented in [the main project README](../README.md). Satisfy those first before proceeding.

Build and run service (on port 80)

```sh
# These instructions are interpreted from docker-compose.yml, zkp section, and the zkp Dockerfile
cd zkp
mkdir -p node_modules
cp -r ../zkp-utils node_modules
cp -r ../account-utils src
cp -r ../config .
npm start
```

Troubleshooting

```sh
# REQUIRES NPM V6.10.1+
# Source https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/2863#issuecomment-514226742
npm update -g npm
```

Run trusted setup

```sh
NODE_ENV=setup npx babel-node code/index.js
```

Clean

```sh
rm -rf node_modules
```
