/**
@module f-token-zkp.js
@author Westlad, iAmMichaelConnor
@desc This code interacts with the blockchain to mint, transfer and burn an f token commitment.
It talks to FTokenShield.sol and you need to give it aninstance of that contract
before it will work. This version works by transforming an existing commitment to a
new one, which enables sending of arbritrary amounts. The code also talks directly to Verifier.
